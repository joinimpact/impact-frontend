Impact is a marketplace platform for discovering and enrolling in volunteering
opportunities. Organizations can sign up and post opportunities which volunteers
can then discover and apply to them. Organizations can view and manage lists of
volunteers and staff. Organizations and volunteers can message one another on our
integrated chat platform and share and manage events via the built-in calendar.
